### Differences Between Static HTML and React Frontend

- **Static HTML (Backend, port 5000):**
  - Pages are served as plain HTML files from the backend.
  - Limited interactivity and dynamic content.
  - Good for simple, static pages.

- **React Frontend (port 3000):**
  - Pages are built as React components using JSX.
  - Supports dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
  - Easier to manage state and complex UI logic.
  - Recommended for modern web applications.

> **Notes:**  
> I found React prefers using JSX files for components instead of plain HTML. JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript, making it easier to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It's not something we discussed in planning, but we might what to consider the switch over HTML. Plan discuss as a group. 

TODO: Find Template for About Page/Login stuff. 
Make sure that the database cooperates with this setup.  

Future Notes for security
bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords securely, crucial for user authentication.
jsonwebtoken (JWT): For implementing token-based authentication in web applications.
